# QuizApplication
This project was created as part of a course where I learned how to build a Quiz application without using any libraries or frameworks. The course was an incredible journey into the core concepts of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Below, you'll find an overview of the project and the key concepts I learned along the way.

# Features
## Save High Scores in Local Storage
I implemented a feature to store and retrieve high scores using the browser's Local Storage. This allowed me to persist user data across sessions.

## Create a Progress Bar
I built a custom progress bar from scratch, which dynamically updates as the quiz progresses. This was a great way to practice my CSS and JavaScript skills.

## Create a Spinning Loader Icon
I designed and implemented a spinning loader icon to indicate when trivia questions were being fetched from the API. This added a nice touch to the user experience.

## Dynamically Generate HTML in JavaScript
Through this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to create and manipulate HTML elements dynamically. This made the quiz interactive and responsive to user input.

## Fetch Trivia Questions from Open Trivia DB API
One of the key features of this project was integrating the Open Trivia DB API. I used the Fetch API to load trivia questions into the quiz, making it more engaging and diverse.
