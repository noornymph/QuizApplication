# QuizApplication
This project was created as part of a course where I learned how to build a Quiz application without using any libraries or frameworks. The course was an incredible journey into the core concepts of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Below, you'll find an overview of the project and the key concepts I learned along the way.

# Features
## Save High Scores in Local Storage
I implemented a feature to store and retrieve high scores using the browser's Local Storage. This allowed me to persist user data across sessions.

## Create a Progress Bar
I built a custom progress bar from scratch, which dynamically updates as the quiz progresses. This was a great way to practice my CSS and JavaScript skills.

## Create a Spinning Loader Icon
I designed and implemented a spinning loader icon to indicate when trivia questions were being fetched from the API. This added a nice touch to the user experience.

## Dynamically Generate HTML in JavaScript
Through this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to create and manipulate HTML elements dynamically. This made the quiz interactive and responsive to user input.

## Fetch Trivia Questions from Open Trivia DB API
One of the key features of this project was integrating the Open Trivia DB API. I used the Fetch API to load trivia questions into the quiz, making it more engaging and diverse.

# What I Learned
## ES6 JavaScript Features
I gained hands-on experience with modern JavaScript syntax, including arrow functions, the spread operator, const and let, and template literals. These features made my code more concise and easier to manage.

## Using the Fetch API
The Fetch API was essential for loading trivia questions from an external API. I learned how to handle asynchronous operations and manage data fetched from external sources.

## Storing High Scores in Local Storage
I explored how to persist data in the browser using Local Storage. This allowed me to create a feature that keeps track of the user's best scores even after they close the browser.

## CSS Flexbox, Animations, and REM Units
I practiced using Flexbox for layout, animations for visual effects, and REM units for responsive design. These CSS techniques helped me create a visually appealing and functional quiz interface.

## Creating a Custom Progress Bar
Building the progress bar was a great way to understand how to use CSS and JavaScript together. I learned how to update the bar dynamically based on user input.

## Building a Spinning Loader Icon
The spinning loader icon was a fun challenge. I learned how to create smooth animations and use keyframes in CSS to bring the icon to life.
